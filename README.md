# NFT Lottery Ticket System
This system enables sellers to create and manage an NFT-based ticketing system in a decentralized and transparent manner using Solidity Smart Contracts.

Participants can deposit funds (USDC or other ERC20) to qualify for a lottery, where winners are randomly selected via [Gelato's VRF](https://www.gelato.network/vrf) service. Second option to get your seats is participation in live auctions.

# Contracts Description
- `NFTLotteryTicket.sol`: Represents tickets as NFTs. Some tickets (depending on auction or lottery type) might be non-transferable (soulbound). Winning the lottery or an auction grants the ability to mint such token.
- `LotteryV1Base.sol`: Enables to participate in initial sale of small portion of tickets. Eligible buyers are selected randomly via VRF.
- `LotteryV2Base.sol`: Allows potential buyers and sellers to roll a dice and generate a random number. Numbers close to the seller's position become eligible for minting.
- `AuctionV1Base.sol`: Customers bid the same price and if there's a higher demand for tickets, lucky bidders are selected via VRF.
- `AuctionV2Base.sol`: First `n` highest bids are eligible to mint tickets (n = number of available tickets)
- `USDC.sol`: This is the currency that will be used by the buyer to participate in the Sale.

# How to deploy & setup
First of all you have to decide on which Blockchain you want to deploy Smart Contracts to. 

You should gather the:
- `Chain ID`, 
- `JSON RPC URL address`
- `Etherscan API Key` - if you want Smart Contracts to be verified (different chain may use different [block explorers](https://www.alchemy.com/alternatives/etherscan), so if this is your case, you can check the [Foundry verify section in their documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract?highlight=verify#forge-verify-contract))


Then you can proceed to deploying Smart Contracts. For that you can use [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/deploying#deploying). After [installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), simply run the command (remember to replace variables - prefixed with $):

```
forge create src/LotteryV1Base.sol:LotteryV1Base \
--rpc-url  $RPC_URL \
--private-key "$WALLET_PIRVATE_KEY" \

        --verify \
        --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
        --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
```

You need to deploy following Smart Contracts from our repo (all in /src directory):
- `NFTTicketBase`,
- `LotteryV1Base`,
- `LotteryV2Base`,
- `AuctionV1Base`,
- `AuctionV2Base`,
- `USDC`.

Finally, you can create a sale! It's a multistep process that requires couple transactions. You don't have to do it manually, but here it comes for you to just know:

1. call `setBaseContracts` on `BlessedFactory`
2. call `createSale` on `BlessedFactory`
3. Create Gelato VRF task for `LotteryV1`, `LotteryV2` and `AuctionV1`.
4. call `requestRandomNumber` on `LotteryV2`
5. call `setSeller` on `LotteryV2`

The whole proceess described above can be taken care of by our app - `Blessed`. It has an API endpoint that is configuring whole Sale for the seller and it can be found [here](https://github.com/BlessedOrg/swifty-app/blob/main/src/app/api/events/%5Bid%5D/deployContracts/route.ts).

## How to deploy and verify Smart Contracts?
You can use foundry for that, simply run the command (remember to replace variables - prefixed with $):
```
forge create src/LotteryV1Base.sol:LotteryV1Base \
    --rpc-url  $RPC_URL \
    --private-key "$WALLET_PIRVATE_KEY" \
    
    --verify \
    --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
    --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
```

# I can't deploy and verify Smart Contract at the same time
```
For some networks, it may be the case that verifing directly from the Foundry will not work. If this is your case, see the next point for manual verification.
```

# How to verify Smart Contract manually?
When script is not working for some reason, the best option is to try use flattened code technique and go to explorer and verify Contract manually.

All you need to do is:
- flatten Contract code using `forge flatten --output ./src/flatten/{ContractName}.flattened.sol ./src/{ContractName}.sol`. For example: `forge flatten --output ./src/flatten/BlessedFactory.flattened.sol ./src/BlessedFactory.sol`
- go to the explorer, type address, click Contract => Verify
- select single file code mode
- paste flattened Contract code
- specify compiler version to 0.8.25
- specify evm version to `paris`
- if you fail to verify, go to `out` folder, find your `{ContractName}.json` file, and under the `rawMetada` object look for the keys `compiler` and `evmVersion`

# Run unit tests locally
**Currently our tests are outdated (due to changes requested by the CDC audit company)!**
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --profile local --locked forge cast chisel anvil
```

```
forge test -vv
```

# Current testnet
Currently for testing we are using Base Sepolia.
